            This notice is to inform you about the policies for collection and use of 
            personally identifiable information on Gopalan Cinemas.com site. Sites which are 
            linked to our site may have different policies; please review the privacy policy 
            notices on those sites for details.</p>
    
        <p  style="margin-top: 0.10in; margin-bottom: 0.10in; text-align: left;">
            We do not collect personally identifiable information about you on this site 
            without your knowledge, and all such information is collected directly from you. 
            For example, we may ask you to provide your e-mail address, name, mailing 
            address, or other information about yourself in order to participate in 
            contests, to be added to the list to receive e-mail updates on new films, to 
            send so-called &quot;postcards&quot;. You are required to provide us with this 
            information, but if you choose not to, you may not be able to participate in 
            some of the activities on this site.</p>
   
      <p>We use the information we collect from you to allow you to participate in the site activities for which the information is collected. For example, when you give us your e-mail address in order to receive updates on new films, that address is added to the e-mail list for that particular category. On each e-mail you receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe; when you unsubscribe, we remove your e-mail address permanently from that mailing list.</p>

            style="margin-top: 0.10in; margin-bottom: 0.10in; text-align: left;">
            For contests conducted on this site, we use the personal information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you. We do not use contact information contained in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other purpose. For further information about how we handle entries to a particular contest, please consult the contest rules.</p>
        <p align="CENTER" style="margin-top: 0.10in; margin-bottom: 0.10in;text-align: left;">
          We do not share personal information provided by site visitors with anyone outside Gopalan Cinemas, except to the extent necessary to allow you to participate in site activities (for example, to send you a prize that you have won in a contest on the site). In particular, we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors to any third party.</p>
            <p align="CENTER" style="margin-top: 0.10in; margin-bottom: 0.10in; text-align: left;">
            We try to keep the information we collect from you as current as possible, and we take steps to maintain the security of your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access to it by those who do not have a legitimate need for it. We will never post your e-mail address or other identifying information you have provided on our site without your consent.</p>
